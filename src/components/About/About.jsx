          I’m Aditya Rajput, an undergraduate Computer Science student at
          Sushila Devi Bansal College of Technology in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. I
          completed my 10th grade at Mar Thoma H.S. School, achieving 63%, and
          my 12th grade at Brilliant Academy H.S. School with a score of 69%. I
          view challenges as valuable opportunities for personal and
          professional growth, which fuels my passion for learning and
          development. I have a strong command of HTML, CSS, and Core Java, and
          I’m building my expertise in React.js. My goal is to combine my
          technical skills with creative problem-solving to develop innovative
          solutions. I’m eager to take on new challenges and projects that will
          allow me to deepen my knowledge and contribute to meaningful work in
          the tech industry.
